Replay Buffer for DreamerV3.

Stores sequences of (observation, action, reward, continue) tuples.
Supports efficient sampling of random sequences for world model training.

Key features:
- Circular buffer for memory efficiency
- Sequential sampling (returns chunks of consecutive timesteps)
- Handles episode boundaries correctly

    """
    Replay buffer for storing and sampling experience sequences.
    
    Unlike standard RL replay buffers that sample individual transitions,
    this buffer samples sequences (chunks) of consecutive transitions.
    This is necessary for training the recurrent world model (RSSM).
    
    Major design ideas:
      1. Environment interaction remains unchanged; we simply accumulate full episodes with distinct IDs and lengths.
      2. When training needs B rollouts, we sample episodes with probability proportional to their length and concatenate them
         (e.g., r_0 = ep_4 + ep_1 + ep_0). While building each rollout we mark the timestep where an episode starts via `is_first`.
      3. Once rollouts exist, we slice them along time into aligned chunks of shape (B, T, C, H, W) plus rewards/continues/is_first
         and feed those chunks to the GPU.
      4. Rollouts only keep enough material to serve the next chunk; if a rollout still lacks T steps after slicing, we append
         additional episodes on demand so that preparation can run alongside training.
      5. During training the `is_first` mask tells the world model whenever h must reset, while other timesteps carry the state forward.
      6. Because different batch elements hit `is_first` independently, downstream code maintains vectorized updates instead of loops.
